      <strong>Hi! I’m Jason Benn.</strong> 
      I build the machine learning pipeline at 
      <a href="https://www.sourceress.com/">Sourceress</a> and live in a badass house in San Francisco called the <a href="http://archive.house/">Archive</a>. 
    </h1>
      <p>
        I also organize an <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://medium.com/paper-club'); return false;" href="https://medium.com/paper-club">academic paper reading club</a> and hack on

        <a onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://github.com/JasonBenn/learn-claire-de-lune/blob/master/README.md'); return false;" href='https://github.com/JasonBenn/learn-claire-de-lune/blob/master/README.md'>projects</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm worried that we're headed for an unemployment crisis and that we're underprepared for it. Thinking that the solution would involve retraining displaced adults, my last job was at a university startup (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/09/the-future-of-college/375071/">the Minerva Project</a>), where I helped build futuristic and effective classroom software. I don't think that's quite the right problem anymore, though. The problem isn't knowing how to learn, and it's certainly not a lack of free educational content: it's that most people have no idea what to pursue (and they don't know which careers are vulnerable to automation), so they make terrible employment choices. So now I'm working on an AI job matchmaker (<a href="https://www.sourceress.com/">Sourceress</a>), because we have customers paying us to send us data about their job openings and the skills they want from candidates. Maybe in the not-so-distant future someone seeking work will be able to see which jobs need people, quantify their skills gaps, and see how others overcame similar gaps.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a cheerier note, I live in a wonderful community and will wax poetic about the lifestyle given even the slightest provocation. Sociologists tell us that the best friendships form in the presence of "proximity, repeated, unplanned interactions; and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other". <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html" class='subtle'>Adults the world over are lamenting how hard it is to make friends after college</a>. Yet the reputation of communal living is either: a) cult, b) den of unwashed hippies, or c) hacker house (shudder) - why? My experience is of a group of reasonable adults who think that life is happier and more interesting when surrounded by inspiring people. I intend to explore such a lifestyle for as long as it is practical, and I hope to grow the Archive to the limits of Dunbar's number and reproduce the college campus vibe.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've also got a bunch of weird stories. Ask me about getting a paragliding license in France in two weeks without knowing French, recording a delightfully amateur rock album as the drummer for my dad's rock band, dancing in a Bob's Burgers-themed burlesque show, the (several) times I've slept on the streets of Europe, the disastrous yet heartwarming Tinder date story I told on the radio, or anonymously publishing a whitepaper under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
      </p>
